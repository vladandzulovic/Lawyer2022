                                    Abortion is illegal in Cyprus up to the extent of a 14 years
                                    prison sentence except under certain narrowed exceptions.
                                    Nevertheless, European Union Law considers abortion as a

                                    even on the criminalisation of abortion, it follows that any Cypriot

                                    freedom of services. This is in relation not only in establishing access to
                                    abortion, but also in claiming refund for up to the total costs that occurred to

                                    Abortion is illegal in Cyprus up to the extent of a 14 years
                                    prison sentence except under certain narrowed exceptions.
                                    Nevertheless, European Union Law considers abortion as a 
                                    ‘Service’ and most of the EU Member States have sufficiently
                                    more relaxed access to abortion services than Cyprus currently does.
                                    Taken as granted that EU Law explicitly overrides Cyprus national law,
                                    even on the criminalisation of abortion, it follows that any Cypriot
                                    woman can vindicate her access to abortion, through the EU principle of
                                    freedom of services. This is in relation not only in establishing access to
                                    abortion, but also in claiming refund for up to the total costs that occurred to
                                    the Cyprus woman by being forced to travel to another Member State in fulfilling such task.
